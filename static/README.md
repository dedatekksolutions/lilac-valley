## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10+
2. Pip and virtual environment tools.
3. AWS CLI configured with proper credentials.
4. Flask and required Python libraries.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone git@github.com:merceiato/lilac-valley.git
   cd lilac-valley
   

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. **Set AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the credentials that have access to the S3 bucket.
   
   aws configure
   

5. **Run the Application**:
   
   python app.py

## **Deployment**

### Set Up AWS EC2

1. Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu.
2. Install required dependencies:
   
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y
   
3. Clone the repository and set up the virtual environment.

### Run the Flask Application


sudo python3 app.py


### Expose Port 8080

Ensure port 8080 is open in the EC2 security group settings.

### Access the Website

Use the public IP of your EC2 instance, e.g., `http://<ec2-public-ip>:8080`.

---

## **Using Gunicorn for Production**

1. **Install Gunicorn**:
   
   pip install gunicorn
   

2. **Test Gunicorn**:
   Run Gunicorn manually to ensure it works with your Flask app:
   
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
   
   - `-w 4`: Number of worker processes (adjust based on your instance’s CPU).
   - `-b 0.0.0.0:8080`: Binds the app to port 8080 and allows access from external IPs.

3. **Access the Website**:
   Use your EC2 instance's public IP or DNS, e.g., `http://<ec2-public-ip>:8080`.

---

## **Optional: Running Flask with Gunicorn as a Systemd Service**

To ensure your Flask app starts automatically on boot using Gunicorn:

1. **Create a Systemd Service File**:
   
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flaskapp.service
   

2. **Add the Following Configuration**:
   ini
   [Unit]
   Description=A Flask app served with Gunicorn
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=ubuntu
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/lilac-valley
   Environment="PATH=/home/ubuntu/myenv/bin"
   ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/myenv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   

   - Replace `/home/ubuntu/` with your actual EC2 instance’s directory structure.

3. **Enable and Start the Service**:
   
   sudo systemctl enable flaskapp
   sudo systemctl start flaskapp
   

4. **Check Service Status**:
   
   sudo systemctl status flaskapp
   

5. **Reload Systemd** (if any changes are made to the service file):
   
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   

The service will now ensure your Flask app runs in the background, restarts on boot, and listens on port 8080.
